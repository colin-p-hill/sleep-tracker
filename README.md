# sleep-tracker
Built for my own use, a sleep data tracker meant to discover what contributes to a restful sleep. This will be a relatively simple Web application exposing both a UI and an API.

## Design Goals:
* No/minimal front-end code
* Web UI that works on both desktop and mobile, obviating the need for a mobile app

## Why Rust?
Because I wanted to learn Rust.

## Licensing
I am at this time issuing no general license. If you want to use this code in ways not already permitted by the laws in your jurisdiction, contact me personally and maybe we can work something out.
